#### To Do

* Create About page.
* Correct and complete contact form.
* Contact form validation and focus styles.
* Complete responsive CSS.
* Add `<noscript>...</noscript>` fallback images?

#### Bugs

* Grid images need placeholder (div is collapsed before image load â€“ should be 288x288), preferably code with background color.
* Fix `<span>*Required</span>` vertical alignment in contact form.
* Contact form margin and padding issues in desktop size.
* Contact form input rounded border in mobile.
